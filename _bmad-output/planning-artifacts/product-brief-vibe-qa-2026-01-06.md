# Product Brief: vibe-qa

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## Executive Summary

**vibe-qa** is a no-code automated testing platform that enables QA teams to test web applications using only a URL and natural language prompts. Powered by generative AI, vibe-qa automatically discovers application functionality, generates comprehensive test plans, and executes tests—eliminating the need for QA engineers to write test automation code.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

QA teams face a significant barrier in test automation: the requirement to write and maintain complex test code. This forces non-technical QA professionals to rely on manual testing or invest heavily in learning programming skills, while technical teams spend excessive time writing and maintaining test scripts instead of focusing on quality analysis.

### Problem Impact

- **Manual Testing Bottleneck**: QA teams without coding skills are limited to slow, error-prone manual testing
- **Resource Intensive**: Writing automated tests requires significant development time and expertise
- **Maintenance Burden**: Test code requires constant updates as applications evolve
- **Coverage Gaps**: Limited automation means critical scenarios may go untested

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current testing tools still require technical expertise, extensive configuration, or fail to intelligently understand application context and generate meaningful test scenarios automatically.

### Proposed Solution

vibe-qa leverages generative AI to analyze web applications, understand their functionality, automatically generate comprehensive test plans, and execute tests—all from a simple URL input. QA teams can focus on test strategy and quality insights rather than test code.

### Key Differentiators

- **True No-Code**: Just provide a URL—no configuration, no scripting, no setup
- **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Generative AI discovers functionality and generates contextually relevant test scenarios
- **End-to-End Automation**: From analysis to test plan generation to execution in one seamless flow
- **Modern Stack**: React + shadcn UI frontend, Node.js + MySQL backend, built for scale and maintainability
